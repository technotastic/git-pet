## Features ‚ú®

*   **Visual Pet:** An ASCII art pet that lives in your terminal.
*   **Mood Dynamics:** Pet's mood (happy, sad, stressed, bored, thinking) reflects your repository's state:
    *   Uncommitted changes
    *   Merge conflicts
    *   Remote sync status (ahead/behind)
    *   Commit frequency
    *   Branch health (old branches)
*   **Basic Needs:** Hunger and Happiness stats decay over time.
*   **Interaction:** `feed` and `play` with your pet to keep it happy. Give it a `name`!
*   **Leveling System:** Gain Experience Points (EXP) for performing Git actions like committing changes, merging branches, and pushing code.
*   **Achievements:** Unlock achievements for Git milestones (first commit, first merge, reaching levels, etc.). üèÜ
*   **Hook Integration:** Install simple Git hooks (`post-commit`, `pre-push`, etc.) to make your pet react automatically to your actions and gain EXP.
*   **Configuration:** Customize behavior like remote status checks via the `config` command.

## Installation üöÄ

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later recommended) installed.

Install Git Pet globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g git-pet
```

This will install the `git-pet` command globally, making it available in any directory.

## Usage üîß

Navigate to any Git repository and run commands:

*   **Check Status (Default):**
    ```bash
    git-pet status
    # Or simply:
    git-pet
    ```

*   **Feed your Pet:**
    ```bash
    git-pet feed
    ```

*   **Play with your Pet:**
    ```bash
    git-pet play
    ```

*   **Name your Pet:**
    ```bash
    git-pet name GittyMcGitface
    ```

*   **View Detailed Summary:**
    ```bash
    git-pet summary
    ```

*   **List Unlocked Achievements:**
    ```bash
    git-pet achievements
    ```

*   **Configure Settings:**
    ```bash
    git-pet config list                       # See current config
    git-pet config set checkRemoteStatus true # Enable remote checks
    ```

*   **Install Git Hooks (Recommended!):**
    *   Run this *inside* your Git repository.
    *   This enables automatic EXP gain and reactions.
    ```bash
    git-pet hooks install
    # Use --force to overwrite existing hooks if needed
    ```

*   **Get Help:**
    ```bash
    git-pet --help
    ```

## Git Hooks

Installing hooks via `git-pet hooks install` places small scripts in your repository's `.git/hooks/` directory. These scripts automatically run the internal `git-pet react <event> [args]` command after certain Git actions (like commits or merges), allowing Git Pet to award EXP and potentially unlock achievements based on your workflow. The installation command automatically determines the correct path to the main `git-pet` script.
